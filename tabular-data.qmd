## Introduction

In this module, we will explore high-performance workflows for tabular data. We will use `duckdbfs` to work with datasets that are larger than available RAM by leveraging DuckDB's streaming and remote file access capabilities.

## Setup

```r
library(duckdbfs)
library(dplyr)
```

## Exploration

Using `open_dataset()` to connect to data sources:

```r
# ds <- open_dataset("path/to/data")
```

Perform filtering and aggregation using `dplyr` syntax...

```r
# ds |> filter(...) |> summarise(...) |> collect()
```
